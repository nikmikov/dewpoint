Simple weather simulation
=========================

### Model characteristic
Gaussian grid 192x98 cells

Every cell is an octagon connected to 8 neighbour cells: heat and air mass transfer provided by wind

Winds are modelled using geostrophic equation. Only geopotential height and coriolis effect affect them
Solar energy heats the air and evaporates water from earth/ocean surface
Evaporation coefficient for cell is constant
Earth energy loss to space per cell is a constant
Ocean water movement is not considered
Clouds/rain/snow?
