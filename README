Simple weather simulation
=========================

### Model characteristic
Gaussian grid 192x98 cells

Heat, atmospheric water mass transfer provided by wind

Winds are modelled using geostrophic equation. Only geopotential height and coriolis effect affect them
Solar energy heats the air and evaporates water from earth/ocean surface
Evaporation coefficient for each cell is constant: 0.3 for land and 1.0 for sea
Earth energy loss to space per cell is a constant
Ocean water movement is not considered


### Build

    stack build

### Requirements

    install python3 modules: netcdf4, numpy

    optional modules for data plotting: matplotlib, basemap

### Import data

    python3 scripts/import_data.py data

    this will download meteostations, heights and land-sea mask data and put them into "data" dir

### Run

    stack exec dewpoint-exe -- --help

    to see list of available options.

    For example command line:

        stack exec -- dewpoint-exe -s "SIN,SYD" -i 5 -d '2016-01-01' -p 60

    will run simulation with 5 minutes step, start date 1st Jan 2016 and output interval 60minutes
    (every 12th iteration) and output weather at stations : SYD and SIN

    use -v,--verbose flag to output extended weather information (useful for debugging)

    visualizing data might be very helpful when debugging:

        stack exec -- dewpoint-exe -s "SIN,SYD" -i 5 -p 60 -o plot | scripts/plot_data.py

        will visualise surface temperature

        stack exec -- dewpoint-exe -s "SIN,SYD" -i 5 -p 60 -o plot | scripts/plot_data.py --wind

        will add winds vector field to the plot
